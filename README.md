# My JavaScript learnings

Just a collection of random quirks, properties or features of JavaScript that I stumble upon. These examples are just made to help myself better understand them and practice them a little.

## Content

- `function-args.js` Different ways to handle arguments in functions
- `getters-and-setters.js` Defining Getters and Setters for object properties
- `object-assing.js` Covering the behavior of the `Object.assign()` method

## Notes

All files are written so you can use [QuokkaJS](https://quokkajs.com/) to see necessary output etc. right in your editor. Since those are all `console.log()` or identifier expressions you can just run them in node or the browser as well.
